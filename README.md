# Real-time-Sign-Language-Interpretation-using-ML-and-CV
This project is based on the sign language interpretation using Machine learning and Computer Vision. 

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust real-time sign language interpretation system using machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) techniques. The system leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and scikit-learn to capture and interpret sign language gestures through a webcam, providing real-time translations.

Objective
To facilitate seamless communication between deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and those who do not understand sign language by developing a real-time sign language interpretation system.

Features
Real-time hand tracking and landmark detection using MediaPipe.
Gesture recognition using machine learning models trained with scikit-learn.
Integration with OpenCV for capturing and processing webcam frames.
User-friendly interface displaying detected signs and their meanings.
